# Sorting Algorithms

#### This repository is home to my implementations of five simple sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, and Selection Sort.

You can read more about these algorithms below...
1. Bubble Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
2. Insertion Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort
3. Merge Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
4. Quicksort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort
5. Selection Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

To see my implementations, check the .js files above. To see how I tested the algorithms, and run the tests in real time, fork and clone this repository to your local computer with your terminal, then navigate into the directory created for this repository. Run `npm init --yes`, followed by `npm i -D mocha chai`. These commands will install the dependencies needed for testing. When the installation process is complete, run `npm test` to see my passing tests. If you'd like to look at my actual test files, run `subl .` and open the "tests" folder.
