# Sorting Algorithms

#### This repository is home to my implementations of five sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, and Selection Sort.

I've included a bit more about these algorithms below...
1. Bubble Sort - bubble sort is a relatively slow method of sorting that sorts a list by traversing the entire list and comparing adjacent values repeatedly until the entire list is sorted and the algorithm passes through the list without making any changes.

2. Insertion Sort - insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm, but this one sorts your list by creating a new list and injecting the element of the original list currently under comparison into the new list where it sees best.

3. Merge Sort - merge sort was probably the toughest for me to implement, because it is the most complex. This sorting method sorts a list by splitting it into sub lists and creating a new list by comparing values in the sub lists.

4. Quicksort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort

5. Selection Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

To see my implementations, look in the "js" folder above this ReadMe. If you'd like to look at my test files, look in the "tests" folder. To see how I actually tested the algorithms, and run the tests in real time, fork and clone this repository to your local computer with your terminal, then navigate into the directory created for this repository.

To install the dependencies neccessary and execute the tests, run the following commands...
1. `npm init --yes`
2. `npm i -D mocha chai`
3. `npm test`
