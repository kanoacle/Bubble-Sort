# Sorting Algorithms

#### This repository is home to my implementations of five simple sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, and Selection Sort.

I've included a bit more about these algorithms below...
1. Bubble Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

2. Insertion Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort

3. Merge Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort

4. Quicksort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort

5. Selection Sort: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

To see my implementations, look in the "js" folder above this ReadMe. If you'd like to look at my test files, look in the "tests" folder. To see how I actually tested the algorithms, and run the tests in real time, fork and clone this repository to your local computer with your terminal, then navigate into the directory created for this repository.

To install the dependencies neccessary and execute the tests, run the following commands...
1. `npm init --yes`
2. `npm i -D mocha chai`
3. `npm test`
